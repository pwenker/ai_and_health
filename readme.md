# Artificial Intelligence & Healthcare - Research Folder

:construction: Research has just started! Come back in a few weeks for more content! :construction:

## Warning

I have **no medical training/education** and I am **not an expert in this research field**.

## Project Purpose

- As a proponent of the [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) movement, and being driven to use *AI for Good*, I created this repository to learn about the opportunities and challenges of *Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare and Medicine*.
- By open-sourcing this repository I hope others may benefit who are similarly starting out doing research in this field!


## Overview

1. There is a [**literature and resources**](docs/literature/readme.md) subfolder organized by subcategories (programmatically created from a [`zotero`](https://www.zotero.org/) library) that contains relevant research papers and other resources along with metadata and a short description about their relevance.
2. There is also a [**knowledge**](docs/knowledge/readme.md) folder containing notes and summaries of papers that I have read more thorougly (e.g. because they contain foundational knowledge).
