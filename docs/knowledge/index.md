# README - Knowledge Folder

- The documents in this folder summarize the content of respective research papers/books (see *limitations* below!).
- Knowledge is represented in a question/answer form to enforce [_retrieval practice_](https://www.learningscientists.org/retrieval-practice) (also known as  _active recall testing_):
  - The process of reformulating the content into the question-and-answer format, and the active engagement of trying to (repeatedly) answer the questions afterwards aims improve memory consolidation. Further, the question answer format allows to dynamically/programmatically query answers to given questions.

## Limitations

The summaries do not aim to completely summarize the respective research papers or books. They are rather subjective summaries of facts and concepts that I determine to be relevant and that I want to
remember. Some parts I might have just missed, others I might have deliberately left out because I'm already familiar with them.
