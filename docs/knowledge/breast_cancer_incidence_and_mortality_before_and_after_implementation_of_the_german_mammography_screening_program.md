### Q: What do the authors conclude?

**Answer**:

-   The observed reduction of late-stage breast cancer incidence in the
    screening exposed age group in Germany is most likely to be
    attributed to the introduction of the national mammography screening
    program.
-   In addition, the observed reduction of disease-specific mortality
    fits the expected pattern, but the proportion to which the
    mammography screening contributed to the reduction is unclear.
-   These positive effects are bought at the cost of a moderate
    occurrence of overdiagnosis, especially by a sharp increase of in
    situ cancers.


### Q: Provide the numbers showing the seriousness of breast cancer in Germany.

**Answer**:

-   Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the most common
    cancer-related cause of death in women in Germany.
-   In 2018, about 72,000 incident cases were expected and about 19,000
    women died from BC in 2016.


### Q: Summarize the history of the German mammography screening program.

**Answer**:

-   To reduce the burden of BC in Germany a public debate about the
    implementation of an organized mammography screening started in the
    1990s.
-   Initial pilot projects were implemented in 2001.
-   In 2002, the German parliament decided to introduce an organized,
    population-based national breast cancer screening program for women
    aged 50--69 years.
-   In 2005, the rollout of the screening program, which is strictly
    following the European guidelines on breast cancer screening
    (EUREF), started and was completely implemented nation-wide
    until 2009.
-   Key features of the program are: 94 mammography units (each covering
    a population of about 500,000 to 1 million), a centralized
    population-based invitation system, invitation every 2 years with a
    proposal of time and place for the examination, independent double
    reading of mammograms, high level quality assurance by reference
    centers and a national evaluation unit with yearly benchmarking.
-   Today almost 100% of German women aged 50 to 69 years are invited to
    the mammography screening every 2 years, and participation rate is
    about 50% since the year 2009.
