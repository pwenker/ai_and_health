##### Overview And Key Challenges

<p><details><summary>Q: What is <b>risk pooling</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div>The instructors define risk pooling as the spreading of financial risks across a large number&nbsp;</div><div>of contributors to a pool, so that the level of risk facing any one person is&nbsp;</div><div>reduced by combining risks across multiple people.&nbsp;</div>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>The main idea is shifting the risk away from the individual, to the group, which can collectively better handle it.</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is a <b>premium</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It's the price charged for an insurance policy.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Describe the different levels of care.</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div><ol><li><b>Primary care</b>: often the first point of entry for medical care; provided by primary care physicians (commonly outpatient setting)</li><li><b>Secondary care</b>: often referred by primary care; provided by specialists, e.g. cardiologists (outpatient and inpatient settings)</li><li><b>Tertiary care</b>: referred from secondary or primary care; usually provided by highly specialized physicians (mostly inpatient, sometimes outpatients settings)</li><li><b>Quaternary care</b>: most specialized care for rare and complex conditions (usually inpatient setting)</li></ol></div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How do the instructors define <b>risk</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div>They define risk as the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of healthcare.</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>insurance companies</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ul><li>The instructors define them as mainly private companies that have been set up to sell a product that we generally call health insurance.&nbsp;</li><li>By selling that product and running their business, they end up pooling risk.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>The product that these companies sell is something that we call an <b>insurance policy</b>.</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are some of the access challenges of healthcare?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li>Lack of insurance coverage (e.g. in the US)</li><li>Socioeconomic disparities</li><li>Differing levels of education</li><li>Cultural issues</li><li>Language barriers</li><li>Lack of providers</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What does it mean when we say some physicians work in <b>inpatient settings</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div>We usually mean healthcare provided to patients in hospitals.</div>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>Patients needing inpatient care are admitted to the hospital, stay there for a period of time and receive care, and then go home when they're done.&nbsp;</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Describe the differing interests of patients, intermediaries and providers.</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li><b>Patients</b>: Stay healthy and get needed medical care.<br></li><li><b>Intermediaries</b>: Manage healthcare risks, identify possible health issues, help patients get access to resources.</li><li><b>Providers</b>: Provide healthcare to patients, manage incoming information, assimilate data from colleagues and systems, better identify patients who need service.</li></ol>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>The lesson is: If you're thinking about where to develop tools for the healthcare system, make sure you're thinking specifically about who can use the tools and why they'd be motivated to use them.</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are the three key challenges of health care systems?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li>The challenge of rising healthcare costs</li><li>The challenge of healthcare quality</li><li>The challenge of healthcare access</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Which four reasons for rising healthcare costs do the instructors list?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li>Populations getting older</li><li>Increase of populations' income and living standards.</li><li>Price increases (the amount of money we pay healthcare providers for any particular service)</li><li>Increases due to technological advances</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How do we call people who have an insurance policy?</summary><b>Answer</b>: They are called&nbsp;<div><ol><li><b>enrollees</b></li><li><b>members</b></li><li><b>beneficiaries&nbsp;</b></li></ol>of the insurance policy.<br></div>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>When they have an insurance policy, we say that they're<b> covered</b>, or that they have coverage for&nbsp;</div><div>the medical care that's included in the policy.</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are the two types of intermediaries?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li>Insurance companies</li><li>Government payers</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>intermediaries</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: The course instructors define intermediaries as entitities that collect funds from a group of people, pool the funds, and use them to pay for healthcare for the people who are covered.

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>There are a couple of synonyms for intermediaries (with slight nuances of meanings), including <b>insurers,</b>&nbsp;<b>payers</b>, and (<b>health) plans</b>.&nbsp;</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Draw an updated version of the simple interaction between providers and patients, now including intermediaries.</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div><br></div><img src="images/paste-d56a50ea5cdce8598e79785f86a932497ea8127b.jpg">

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What does it mean when we say many physicians work in&nbsp;<b>outpatient settings</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: By outpatient setting, we generally mean outside of a hospital.

<b><i>Example</i></b>: For example, they may work in a physician office or a clinic (referred to as a <i>physician surgery</i> in some places).&nbsp;

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>In outpatient care, patients come in, see a provider, get any consultation or treatment that they need and then go back home, generally all in the <i>same day</i>.&nbsp;</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is a solution to the <b>problem of risk</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <b>Risk pooling</b>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is an <b>insurance policy</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div>The instructors define it as a contract that provides for paying the medical bills of the holder, usually under some conditions.&nbsp;</div>

<b><i>Example</i></b>: <div>Examples of conditions are:</div><div><ul><li>It could be that you have to pay part of the cost yourself and the insurer will pay the rest.&nbsp;</li><li>It could be that costs are covered if you see providers that your insurance company has arrangements with but not other providers.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: <div>It will generally say that if you have this insurance policy then your healthcare costs will be paid, maybe under some conditions, by the insurance company that sold you the policy.</div>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Draw an image of the simple interaction between providers and patients.</summary><b>Answer</b>: <img src="images/paste-91118da77843f7095cc55dcc8704fee7dac93cd0.jpg">

#### Module 2


##### Physician Practices And Physician Payments

<p><details><summary>Q: What are the three challenges for the quality of healthcare?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <div><ol><li>Underuse</li><li>Overuse</li><li>Misuse</li></ol></div>

<b><i>Example</i></b>: <ol><li><i>Underuse</i>: Variety of cases where beneficial, preventive care is not used as widely as it could be or perhaps should be.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Overuse</i>: Performing MRI scans for too many patients with low back pain.</li><li><div><i>Misuse</i>: Giving a patient a medication that interacted badly with another medicine the patient was taking, leading to problems maybe because someone wasn't keeping track well enough of&nbsp;</div><div>all the medications that a patient was taking.&nbsp;<br></div></li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How do the instructors define <b>capitation </b>payment?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is defined as payment per person, per unit of time.

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: This can be seen as the opposite from <b>FFS</b> payment.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Explain how capitation payments can lead to a shift of risk from the intermediary to the provider.</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ul><li>Capitation payment means that the provider is payed per patient and unit of time, irrespective of the number of services.</li><li>This means that, especially for solo practice and small physician groups, there is the risk that the fixed, prospective payments insufficiently cover the actually provided care.</li></ul>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Which incentives are generated by capitation payment systems and what are associated risks?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ul><li>Capitation creates the incentive to reduce the number of services and generally provide less care.</li><li>While this reduces the amount of unnecessary services, it increases the risk of <b>underuse</b>.</li></ul>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Which incentives are generated by FFS payment systems and what are associated risks?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ul><li>FFS creates incentives to increase the number of services and favor more expensive ones.</li><li>While this ensures that the patient gets what is needed, it creates the risk of <i>overuse</i>.</li></ul>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is <b>Fee for Service (FFS)</b> payment?</summary><b>Answer</b>: In this payment model, a doctor is paid for <i>each</i> service that she or he provides.<br>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is <b>Medicare</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is the US government payer that provides coverage for people mainly over the age of 65.<br>

</details></p>

##### Hospitals And Payment Systems

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>hospitals</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: They are organizations that provide facilities and staff to offer medical care.

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: They can operate as
private businesses, on a for-profit or a not-for-profit basis, and some hospitals are owned or operated by governmet organizations.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is a defining characteristic of a hospital?</summary><b>Answer</b>: The provision of beds and infrastructure for inpatient care.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are the two kinds of relationships between hospitals and physicians?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li>Hospitals may employ physicians directly</li><li>A physician may have an arrangement to practice at the hospital, but still have a separate practice.</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>admitting privileges</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: These are arrangements for physicians to provide services at a hospital.

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: In this case, physician practice and hospital are still separate businesses and probably paid separately.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is a <b>hospital network</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is a group of hospitals with whom an insurer works, and which enrollees are required or encouraged to use.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is a <b>chargemaster </b>of a hospital?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is a list of all the services that a hospital provides, and the amount that the hospital charges for each service.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How does <b>per diem</b> payment work?</summary><b>Answer</b>: In a <b>per diem</b> payment system intermediaries pay a fixed amount to the hospital for each patient per day.

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: This payment is a prospective payment since it does not regard the actual hospital's charges incurred for the provided services.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>Diagnosis-Related Groups</b> (<b>DRG</b>)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is a payment system where hospitals are paid a flat amount for each patient's hospital stay based on the given diagnosis.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is the&nbsp;<b>global budget model</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is a payment system for inpatient care, where hospital is paid a fixed amount for a period of time (often a year).

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: Which are the four payment systems for hospitals?</summary><b>Answer</b>: <ol><li>Fee for service</li><li>Per diem</li><li>Diagnosis-related group</li><li>Global budget</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How can FFS, Per diem, DRG and Global budget systems be arranged according to the incentives they create?</summary><b>Answer</b>: They can be arranged according to the incentive they create to provide care from <i>most </i>care to <i>least</i> care in the following way:<br><ol><li>Fee for service</li><li>Per diem</li><li>Diagnosis-related group</li><li>Global budget</li></ol>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: More care can lead to overuse, less care can lead to underuse!

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How can FFS, Per diem, DRG and Global budget systems be arranged according to the amount of risk transferred from intermediaries to hospitals?</summary><b>Answer</b>: They can be arranged from less risk to most risk transferred according to:<br><ol><li>Fee for service</li><li>Per diem</li><li>Diagnosis-related group</li><li>Global budget</li></ol>

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>hospital systems</b>?</summary><b>Answer</b>: These are larger large organizations consisting of many hospitals that are part of the same company.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What are <b>physician-hospital organizations</b> (<b>PHO</b>'s)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: These are larger organizations consisting of many hospitals that are part of the same company.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: How do we call large PHO's with a broader representation of physicians?</summary><b>Answer</b>: We then apply the term: <b>integrated delivery network</b> (<b>IDN</b>).

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is an <b>integrated delivery network</b> (<b>IDN</b>)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is an entity that owns, or closely integrates, many providers of different types to provide a broad range of care.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is an&nbsp;<b>Accountable Care Organization</b>&nbsp;(<b>ACO</b>)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is an organization that works to create <i>clinical integration (</i>providers work together to seliver integrated and coordinated patient care<i>)&nbsp;</i>across many providers.<br>

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: Here, each provider or organization can voluntarily associate with the ACO, have some contractual arrangements, but stay in their own separate
organization.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is <b>pay-for-performance</b> (<b>P4P</b>)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is the use of financial incentives or penalties based on whether or not a provider meets some set of performance expectations (focused on the quality of care).

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is an <b>electrical medical record</b> (<b>EMR</b>)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It is a digitized version of a patient's medical record.

</details></p>

<p><details><summary>Q: What is a <b>personal health record</b> (<b>PHR</b>)?</summary><b>Answer</b>: It commonly refers to an electronic application for patients to record their own personal health information.

<b><i>Remarks</i></b>: This may be for the patients' own use or to share with their healthcare providers.
