### Q: How do the instructors define **risk**?

**Answer**:

<div>

They define risk as the possibility of facing a financial loss
associated with the use of healthcare.

</div>


### Q: What is a solution to the **problem of risk**?

**Answer**: **Risk pooling**


### Q: What is **risk pooling**?

**Answer**:

<div>

The instructors define risk pooling as the spreading of financial risks
across a large number 

</div>

<div>

of contributors to a pool, so that the level of risk facing any one
person is 

</div>

<div>

reduced by combining risks across multiple people. 

</div>

***Remarks***:

<div>

The main idea is shifting the risk away from the individual, to the
group, which can collectively better handle it.

</div>


### Q: What are **intermediaries**?

**Answer**: The course instructors define intermediaries as entitities
that collect funds from a group of people, pool the funds, and use them
to pay for healthcare for the people who are covered. ***Remarks***:

<div>

There are a couple of synonyms for intermediaries (with slight nuances
of meanings), including **insurers,** **payers**, and (**health)
plans**. 

</div>


### Q: What are the two types of intermediaries?

**Answer**:

1.  Insurance companies
2.  Government payers


### Q: What are **insurance companies**?

**Answer**:

-   The instructors define them as mainly private companies that have
    been set up to sell a product that we generally call health
    insurance. 
-   By selling that product and running their business, they end up
    pooling risk. 

***Remarks***:

<div>

The product that these companies sell is something that we call an
**insurance policy**.

</div>


### Q: What is an **insurance policy**?

**Answer**:

<div>

The instructors define it as a contract that provides for paying the
medical bills of the holder, usually under some conditions. 

</div>

***Example***:

<div>

Examples of conditions are:

</div>

<div>

-   It could be that you have to pay part of the cost yourself and the
    insurer will pay the rest. 
-   It could be that costs are covered if you see providers that your
    insurance company has arrangements with but not other providers. 

</div>

***Remarks***:

<div>

It will generally say that if you have this insurance policy then your
healthcare costs will be paid, maybe under some conditions, by the
insurance company that sold you the policy.

</div>


### Q: How do we call people who have an insurance policy?

**Answer**: They are called 

<div>

1.  **enrollees**
2.  **members**
3.  **beneficiaries **

of the insurance policy.\

</div>

***Remarks***:

<div>

When they have an insurance policy, we say that they\'re **covered**, or
that they have coverage for 

</div>

<div>

the medical care that\'s included in the policy.

</div>


### Q: What is a **premium**?

**Answer**: It\'s the price charged for an insurance policy.


### Q: Draw an updated version of the simple interaction between providers and patients, now including intermediaries.

### Q: What does it mean when we say many physicians work in **outpatient settings**?

**Answer**: By outpatient setting, we generally mean outside of a
hospital. ***Example***: For example, they may work in a physician
office or a clinic (referred to as a *physician surgery* in some
places).  ***Remarks***:

<div>

In outpatient care, patients come in, see a provider, get any
consultation or treatment that they need and then go back home,
generally all in the *same day*. 

</div>


### Q: What does it mean when we say some physicians work in **inpatient settings**?

**Answer**:

<div>

We usually mean healthcare provided to patients in hospitals.

</div>

***Remarks***:

<div>

Patients needing inpatient care are admitted to the hospital, stay there
for a period of time and receive care, and then go home when they\'re
done. 

</div>


### Q: Describe the different levels of care.

**Answer**:

<div>

1.  **Primary care**: often the first point of entry for medical care;
    provided by primary care physicians (commonly outpatient setting)
2.  **Secondary care**: often referred by primary care; provided by
    specialists, e.g. cardiologists (outpatient and inpatient settings)
3.  **Tertiary care**: referred from secondary or primary care; usually
    provided by highly specialized physicians (mostly inpatient,
    sometimes outpatients settings)
4.  **Quaternary care**: most specialized care for rare and complex
    conditions (usually inpatient setting)

</div>



#### 2 Three Key Challenges Facing Healthcare Systems

### Q: What are the three key challenges of health care systems?

**Answer**:

1.  The challenge of rising healthcare costs
2.  The challenge of healthcare quality
3.  The challenge of healthcare access


### Q: Which four reasons for rising healthcare costs do the instructors list?

**Answer**:

1.  Populations getting older
2.  Increase of populations\' income and living standards.
3.  Price increases (the amount of money we pay healthcare providers for
    any particular service)
4.  Increases due to technological advances


### Q: What are the three challenges for the quality of healthcare?

**Answer**:

<div>

1.  Underuse
2.  Overuse
3.  Misuse

</div>

***Example***:

1.  *Underuse*: Variety of cases where beneficial, preventive care is
    not used as widely as it could be or perhaps should be. 

2.  *Overuse*: Performing MRI scans for too many patients with low back
    pain.

3.  <div>

    *Misuse*: Giving a patient a medication that interacted badly with
    another medicine the patient was taking, leading to problems maybe
    because someone wasn\'t keeping track well enough of 

    </div>

    <div>

    all the medications that a patient was taking. \

    </div>


### Q: What are some of the access challenges of healthcare?

**Answer**:

1.  Lack of insurance coverage (e.g. in the US)
2.  Socioeconomic disparities
3.  Differing levels of education
4.  Cultural issues
5.  Language barriers
6.  Lack of providers



#### 3 Lessons For Ai And Data

### Q: Describe the differing interests of patients, intermediaries and providers.

**Answer**:

1.  **Patients**: Stay healthy and get needed medical care.\
2.  **Intermediaries**: Manage healthcare risks, identify possible
    health issues, help patients get access to resources.
3.  **Providers**: Provide healthcare to patients, manage incoming
    information, assimilate data from colleagues and systems, better
    identify patients who need service.

***Remarks***:

<div>

The lesson is: If you\'re thinking about where to develop tools for the
healthcare system, make sure you\'re thinking specifically about who can
use the tools and why they\'d be motivated to use them.

</div>



### Week 2 Introduction To Healthcare


#### 2 Physician Payment

### Q: What is **Fee for Service (FFS)** payment?

**Answer**: In this payment model, a doctor is paid for *each* service
that she or he provides.\


### Q: What is **Medicare**?

**Answer**: It is the US government payer that provides coverage for
people mainly over the age of 65.\


### Q: How do the instructors define **capitation** payment?

**Answer**: It is defined as payment per person, per unit of time.
***Remarks***: This can be seen as the opposite from **FFS** payment.


### Q: Explain how capitation payments can lead to a shift of risk from the intermediary to the provider.

**Answer**:

-   Capitation payment means that the provider is payed per patient and
    unit of time, irrespective of the number of services.
-   This means that, especially for solo practice and small physician
    groups, there is the risk that the fixed, prospective payments
    insufficiently covers the actually provided care.


### Q: Which incentives are generated by FFS payment systems and what are associated risks?

**Answer**:

-   FFS creates incentives to increase the number of services and favor
    more expensive ones.
-   While this ensures that the patient gets what is needed, it creates
    the risk of *overuse*.


### Q: Which incentives are generated by capitation payment systems and what are associated risks?

**Answer**:

-   Capitation creates the incentive to reduce the number of services
    and generally provide less care.
-   While this reduces the amount of unnecessary services, it increases
    the risk of **underuse**.
