# Artificial Intelligence & Healthcare - Research Folder

:construction: Research has just started! Come back in a few weeks for more content! :construction:

## Warning

I have **no medical training/education** and I am **not an expert in this research field**.

## Project Purpose

- As a proponent of the [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) movement, and being driven to use *AI for Good*, I created this repository to learn about the opportunities and challenges of *Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare and Medicine*.
- By open-sourcing this repository I hope others may benefit who are similarly starting out doing research in this field!


## Overview

1. There is a [**literature and resources**](docs/literature/readme.md) subfolder organized by subcategories (programmatically created from a [`zotero`](https://www.zotero.org/) library) that contains relevant research papers and other resources along with metadata and a short description about their relevance.
2. There is also a [**knowledge**](docs/knowledge/readme.md) folder containing notes and summaries of papers that I have read more thoroughly (e.g. because they contain foundational knowledge). 

## How to Contribute

- Most of the content you see here is programmatically exported from somewhere else. So please don't try to create a pull request, but instead open an issue and tell me there what you want to have added or changed! I'm happy to hear about important resources, tools, or research papers that I have missed so far!
- Don't hesitate to share any (constructive) criticism! I love to learn and would be glad If I could use your feedback to improve the quality of this resource collection!

## How to Support

If this project provides some value to you, I'd be happy if you do any of the following:

- Contribute to this project (see above).
- Share this project with anyone who might find it useful as well.
- Pay it forward: do something good for someone else. If you need some ideas, take a look at [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/).
