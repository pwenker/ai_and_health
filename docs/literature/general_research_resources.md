# General Research Resources

This collection contains websites, resources and tools that I use to support, automate and generally improve my research and literature reviews.



## Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards :book:

**Link**: https://apps.ankiweb.net/

**Abstract**:

- Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.
- Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

**Relevance**:
- We loose what we don't use. Thanks to you, evolution.
- I use Anki whenever I want to remember facts and knowledge. In fact, what you find at https://pwenker.com/ai_and_health/knowledge also lives in an Anki collection and was exported from there.
- Two things you should look up, if you don't know them: 1. Spaced Repetition 2. Retrieval Practice. You'll thank me later (if you don't forget).



## Zotero | Your personal research assistant :book:

**Link**: https://www.zotero.org/

**Abstract**:

Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research.

**Relevance**:
- Zotero is a corner stone of my research!
- I use it to organize my research 
- To give you a very specific example, let's look at what you are reading right now! I opened the Zotero webpage in my browser and used a Zotero browser extension, to import this snapshot with only one click. Zotero already fills in some information automatically, like the link to the webpage, the title, and often times a fitting abstract. I only added the very sentences you are reading now into the *Abstract* field of the entry. Then I used some Python scripting to export the whole collection (including this very entry) to the repository you are currently looking at.



## Connected Papers | Find and explore academic papers :book:

**Link**: https://www.connectedpapers.com/

**Abstract**:

A unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.

**Relevance**: 
- If you start researching a new field, it's often a struggle to find good introductory research papers. Here, *Connected Papers* comes to your rescue!
-  I like to start a literature research by just putting the name of the field, e.g. Deep Reinforcement Learning into the *Connected Papers* search field and let it build a graph.
- It immediately shows you (at least some of) the most relevant and foundational research papers (node size) and useful connections between them (edges).



## ShortScience.org - Making Science Accessible! :book:

**Link**: https://www.shortscience.org/

**Abstract**:

- ShortScience.org is a platform for post-publication discussion aiming to improve accessibility and reproducibility of research ideas.
- The website has 1547 public summaries, mostly in machine learning, written by the community and organized by paper, conference, and year.
- Reading summaries of papers is useful to obtain the perspective and insight of another reader, why they liked or disliked it, and their attempt to demystify complicated sections.
- Also, writing summaries is a good exercise to understand the content of a paper because you are forced to challenge your assumptions when explaining it.
- Finally, you can keep up to date with the flood of research by reading the latest summaries on our Twitter and Facebook pages.

**Relevance**:
- This is best explained by: https://www.shortscience.org/about



## Papers with Code - The latest in Machine Learning :book:

**Link**: https://paperswithcode.com/

**Abstract**:

Papers With Code highlights trending Machine Learning research and the code to implement it.

**Relevance**:
- What's is the worth of a research paper without an actual implementation? Often times: *nothing*.
- Papers With Code has the laudable mission to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code and evaluation tables.
- It's an amazing starting place to find datasets, benchmarks and research papers with high-quality implementations.
- I also find it particularly useful to get an overview about which subcategories a specific field has. For example, https://paperswithcode.com/area/medical helped me to choose an initial structure for this research collection.



## Google Scholar :book:

**Link**: https://scholar.google.com/

**Abstract**:

Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites.

**Relevance**:
- I simply use Google Scholar to find research papers.
- Additionally, it allows you, for a given research paper, to find other papers that cite it, or that are deemed to be similar.
