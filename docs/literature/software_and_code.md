**Abstract**:

The aim of healthcareai is to make machine learning in healthcare as easy as possible. It does that by providing functions to:

- Develop customized, reliable, high-performance machine learning models with minimal code
- Easily make and evaluate predictions and push them to a database
- Understand how a model makes its predictions
- Make data cleaning, manipulation, imputation, and visualization as simple as possible
