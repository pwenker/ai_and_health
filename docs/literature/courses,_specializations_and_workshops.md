# Courses, Specializations and Workshops

This collection aims to list free high-quality courses, specializations and workshops.

*Note*: 
Some of the specializations may charge you if you want to earn a degree/certificate, but 
you can "audit" the courses for free if you are happy with only reading and viewing the course content.



## Machine Learning for Healthcare (MIT 6.S897/HST.S53) :book:

**Link**: https://mlhc17mit.github.io/

**Abstract**:

- Explores machine learning methods for clinical and healthcare applications. 
- Covers concepts of algorithmic fairness, interpretability, and causality. 
- Discusses application of time-series analysis, graphical models, deep learning and transfer learning methods to solving problems in healthcare. 
- Considers how newly emerging machine learning techniques will shape healthcare policy and personalized medicine.



## AI in Healthcare (Coursera) :book:

**Link**: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-healthcare

**Abstract**:

- Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries around the world, and has the potential to radically alter the field of healthcare. Imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic, medications prescribed, lab tests, and procedures performed, as well as data outside the health system -- such as social media, purchases made using credit cards, census records, Internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information, and you’ll get a sense of how AI could transform patient care and diagnoses.
- In this specialization, we'll discuss the current and future applications of AI in healthcare with the goal of learning to bring AI technologies into the clinic safely and ethically.  
- This specialization is designed for both healthcare providers and computer science professionals, offering insights to facilitate collaboration between the disciplines.



## AI for Medicine (Coursera) :book:

**Link**: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine

**Abstract**:

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. This three-course Specialization will give you practical experience in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine.



## Learn to Utilize AI in Healthcare (Udacity) :book:

**Link**: https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-healthcare-nanodegree--nd320

**Abstract**:

Learn to build, evaluate, and integrate predictive models that have the power to transform patient outcomes. Begin by classifying and segmenting 2D and 3D medical images to augment diagnosis and then move on to modeling patient outcomes with electronic health records to optimize clinical trial testing decisions. Finally, build an algorithm that uses data collected from wearable devices to estimate the wearer’s pulse rate in the presence of motion.
