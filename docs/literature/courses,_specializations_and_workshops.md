## AI in Healthcare (Coursera) :book:

**Link**: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-healthcare

**Abstract**:

- Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries around the world, and has the potential to radically alter the field of healthcare. Imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic, medications prescribed, lab tests, and procedures performed, as well as data outside the health system -- such as social media, purchases made using credit cards, census records, Internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information, and you’ll get a sense of how AI could transform patient care and diagnoses.
- In this specialization, we'll discuss the current and future applications of AI in healthcare with the goal of learning to bring AI technologies into the clinic safely and ethically.  
- This specialization is designed for both healthcare providers and computer science professionals, offering insights to facilitate collaboration between the disciplines.

## Learn to Utilize AI in Healthcare (Udacity) :book:

**Link**: https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-healthcare-nanodegree--nd320

**Abstract**:

Learn to build, evaluate, and integrate predictive models that have the power to transform patient outcomes. Begin by classifying and segmenting 2D and 3D medical images to augment diagnosis and then move on to modeling patient outcomes with electronic health records to optimize clinical trial testing decisions. Finally, build an algorithm that uses data collected from wearable devices to estimate the wearer’s pulse rate in the presence of motion.
