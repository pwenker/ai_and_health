The initial model was a great success, leveraging Google search data to predict flu incidence. However, without update the model began to overestimate flu incidence in subsequent years as user search behaviors had shifted. While the drift was unintentional, the example motivates the need for models that continuously update. Q: According to the authors, which are the three key factors to consider with outcome definitions? Answer : Creating reliable outcomes, Understanding the relevance of an outcome clinically, and The subtlety of label leakage. Q: Provide the authors' example of the Simpson's paradox (asthmatic patients admitted to the hospital for pneumonia). Answer : In prior work, researchers found that asthmatic patients who were admitted to the hospital for pneumonia were more aggressively treated for the infection, lowering the subpopulation mortality rate. Hence, a model that predicts death from asthma will learn that asthma is protective. If, however, an additional variable to account for the level of care is included, the model may instead find that having asthma increases the risk of death. Remarks : This example demonstrates that causal models are not only useful to evaluate treatments, but can also help to build reliable predictive models that do not make harmful predictions using relationships caused by treatment policies in the training data. To account for these challenges, strong assumptions must be made that cannot be statistically checked or validated; i.e., gathering more data will not help. Q: Describe the challenge of \"label leakage\". Answer : The information collected in an individual\u2019s hospital encounter is tightly coupled across time, and this can result in information about the targeted task outcome leaking back into features. While exploiting such relationships between features and targets is a goal of learning, information leakage can render a prediction meaningless. Example : Consider predicting mortality of hospital patients using all available data up until their time of death. Such a task could lead to a pathological prediction rule\u2014\u201dif the ventilator is turned off in the preceding hour, predict death.\u201d This commonly happens when patients and their families decide to withdraw care at a terminal stage of illness. A machine learning algorithm trained naively on this signal would have high predictive performance by nearly any metric, yet absolutely no clinical utility. Q: Provide the authors' argument of \"Moving from interpretation to justification\". Answer : In other domains, many forms of interpretability rely on human expertise, e.g., a model may highlight a single sentence from a user review (\u201cThe coffee is wonderful.\u201d) as the rationale for a review prediction. Clinicians are unlikely to have a similar contextual framework, and it is unlikely to be obvious what a particular pattern of lab measurements that maximally activates a model means, biologically or clinically. The authors argue that models should instead provide \u201cjustifiability\u201d; beyond explaining a specific prediction, models should strive towards justifying the predictive path itself. Example : For example, recent work has proposed that locally-interpretable results can be presented for each individual prediction. Another possibility is learning influence functions to trace a model\u2019s prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. Remarks : Outside of reassuring end users, justifying a machine learning algorithm\u2019s decision is also important for security concerns, as medicine may be uniquely vulnerable to \u201cadversarial attacks\u201d. Q: Provide some of the examples of ensuring interpretability of machine learning models. Answer : There are many possible ways to interpretability, e.g., through feature space minimization, model regularization, or a preference for particular classes of models that have well-known post-hoc analysis methods. Example : For example, providing a posterior distribution over possible decision lists. Such lists can provide a natural way for clinicians to think about the relative risks of their patient\u2019s condition. Q: Describe the importance of creating reliable outcomes from heterogeneous source data. Answer : Multiple data sources should be considered when creating labels because EHRs often lack precise structured labels. Or, in some cases, structured labels may be unreliable. Example : For example, a diagnostic clinical code for pneumonia could mean a patient was screened for pneumonia rather than that they actually had pneumonia. Machine learning methods to pool different data types and obtain a more reliable label is known as phenotyping, and is an important subfield of machine learning in healthcare. Remarks : Recent work has emphasized the need to integrate the rich information available in clinical notes, and building natural language processing pipelines to extract information from unstructured clinical text accurately is an active subject of research. Q: Describe the concept of precision medicine for early individualized treatment. Answer : Precision medicine seeks to individualize the treatment of each patient This is particularly important for syndromes\u2014conditions defined by a collection of symptoms whose causes are unknown. Example : For instance, acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a collection of symptoms characterizing kidney failure, not an underlying cause. Two individuals may have developed AKI for different reasons because there are many reasons that kidneys can fail. More measurements of the two individuals could reveal the difference in cause, which may in turn suggest alternative treatment strategies. By personalizing over time, one can learn individual-specific treatment effects that address the cause of the syndrome in a particular individual. This relates to the ideas from \u201cN=1\u201d crossover studies in experimental design. Personalized treatment is enabled by growing repositories of longitudinal data, where long-term progressions of an individual\u2019s health are available. Q: Provide the authors' example (the measuring of lactate levels) of the three missing data mechanisms MCAR, MAR, MNAR . Answer : For example, lab measurements are typically ordered as part of a diagnostic work-up, meaning that the presence of a datapoint conveys information about the patient\u2019s state. Consider a hospital where clinical staff measures patient lactate level. If a power outage led to a set of lactate levels being lost, the data are MCAR. If nurses are less likely to measure lactate levels in patients with traumatic injury, and we record whether patients were admitted with trauma, the data are MAR. However, if nurses are less likely to measure lactate levels when believed to be already, then the lactate measures themselves are MNAR, and the measurement of the signal itself is meaningful. Remarks : The key feature of missing data is that there may be information conveyed by the absence of an observation, and ignoring this dependence may lead to models that make incorrect, and even harmful, predictions. Q: What is an electronic health record (EHR)? Answer : An electronic health record (EHR) is the systematized collection of patient and population health information electronically stored in a digital format. Remarks : EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record#cite_note-1 Q: Describe the challenge of \"External Validity - Shift over sources\" (Non-stationarity in learning and deployment) Answer : There is also no reason to believe a priori that a model learned from one hospital will generalize to a new one. Many factors impact generalizability, including local hospital practices, different patient populations, available equipment, and even the specific kind of EHR each uses\u2014transitions from one EHR to another create non-obvious feature mapping problems. Remarks : This issue will remain until infrastructure to easily test across multiple sites becomes prevalent. The absence of such standardization creates opportunities with respect to data normalization and the development of models that are robust to differences in data collection at different sites. Q: Which three widely accepted classifications of missing data mechanisms exist? Answer : The first, missing completely at random ( MCAR ), posits a fixed probability of missingness. In this case, dropping incomplete observations\u2014known as complete case analysis\u2014is commonly used (albeit naively), and will lead to unbiased results. Second, the data may be missing at random ( MAR ), where the probability of missingness is random conditional on the observed variables. In this case, common methods include re-weighting data with methods like inverse probability of censoring weighting or using multiple imputations to in-fill. Finally, data may be missing not at random ( MNAR ), where the probability of missingness depends on the missing variable itself, or other missing and unobserved variables. Q: Describe the importance of the integration of fragmented records. Answer : Finite resources can also lead to a lack of communication and coordination, affecting patient care. Example : For example, it can take years to identify domestic abuse survivors because any single clinical visit in isolation may be consistent with other causes (e.g. an admission for bruising is consistent with a spontaneous fall). Only a thorough review of a patient\u2019s record will demonstrate the pattern of repeated admissions and other indicators (e.g., partners\u2019 alcohol abuse). While possible without support systems in principle, machine learning can be a powerful tool, e.g., identifying domestic abuse up to 30 months in advance of the healthcare system. Q: According to the authors, which three factors should be considered carefully in the design and evaluation of machine learning projects? Answer : Causality, Missingness, and Outcome definition.","title":"A Review of Challenges and Opportunities in Machine Learning for Health"},{"location":"knowledge/a_review_of_challenges_and_opportunities_in_machine_learning_for_health.html#a-review-of-challenges-and-opportunities-in-machine-learning-for-health","text":"","title":"A Review of Challenges and Opportunities in Machine Learning for Health"},{"location":"knowledge/a_review_of_challenges_and_opportunities_in_machine_learning_for_health.html#artificial-intelligence","text":"","title":"Artificial Intelligence"},{"location":"knowledge/a_review_of_challenges_and_opportunities_in_machine_learning_for_health.html#health","text":"","title":"Health"},{"location":"knowledge/a_review_of_challenges_and_opportunities_in_machine_learning_for_health.html#overview","text":"Q: Describe the authors' \"Google Flue Trends\"-example about \"Internal Validity - Shift over time\" (Non-stationarity in learning and deployment) Answer : In a notable example of concept drift, Google Flu Trends persistently overestimated flu due to shifts in search behaviors.

Answer : Causality, Missingness, and Outcome definition.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"knowledge/ai_in_healthcare_specialization_-_introduction_to_healthcare.html","text":"AI in Healthcare Specialization - Introduction to Healthcare \u00b6 Ai In Healthcare \u00b6 Introduction To Healthcare \u00b6 Module 1 \u00b6 Overview And Key Challenges \u00b6 Q: Describe the differing interests of patients, intermediaries and providers. Answer : Patients : Stay healthy and get needed medical care. Intermediaries : Manage healthcare risks, identify possible health issues, help patients get access to resources. Providers : Provide healthcare to patients, manage incoming information, assimilate data from colleagues and systems, better identify patients who need service. Remarks : The lesson is: If you're thinking about where to develop tools for the healthcare system, make sure you're thinking specifically about who can use the tools and why they'd be motivated to use them. Q: What are the two types of intermediaries? Answer : Insurance companies Government payers Q: How do we call people who have an insurance policy? Answer : They are called enrollees members beneficiaries of the insurance policy. Remarks : When they have an insurance policy, we say that they're covered , or that they have coverage for the medical care that's included in the policy. Q: What are the three key challenges of health care systems? Answer : The challenge of rising healthcare costs The challenge of healthcare quality The challenge of healthcare access Q: Which four reasons for rising healthcare costs do the instructors list? Answer : Populations getting older Increase of populations' income and living standards. Price increases (the amount of money we pay healthcare providers for any particular service) Increases due to technological advances Q: Draw an updated version of the simple interaction between providers and patients, now including intermediaries. Answer : Q: What are intermediaries ? Answer : The course instructors define intermediaries as entitities that collect funds from a group of people, pool the funds, and use them to pay for healthcare for the people who are covered. Remarks : There are a couple of synonyms for intermediaries (with slight nuances of meanings), including insurers, payers , and ( health) plans . Q: What does it mean when we say many physicians work in outpatient settings ? Answer : By outpatient setting, we generally mean outside of a hospital. Example : For example, they may work in a physician office or a clinic (referred to as a physician surgery in some places). Remarks : In outpatient care, patients come in, see a provider, get any consultation or treatment that they need and then go back home, generally all in the same day . Q: What is an insurance policy ? Answer : The instructors define it as a contract that provides for paying the medical bills of the holder, usually under some conditions. Example : Examples of conditions are: It could be that you have to pay part of the cost yourself and the insurer will pay the rest. It could be that costs are covered if you see providers that your insurance company has arrangements with but not other providers. Remarks : It will generally say that if you have this insurance policy then your healthcare costs will be paid, maybe under some conditions, by the insurance company that sold you the policy. Q: Draw an image of the simple interaction between providers and patients. Answer : Q: What is a solution to the problem of risk ? Answer : Risk pooling Q: What is risk pooling ? Answer : The instructors define risk pooling as the spreading of financial risks across a large number of contributors to a pool, so that the level of risk facing any one person is reduced by combining risks across multiple people. Remarks : The main idea is shifting the risk away from the individual, to the group, which can collectively better handle it. Q: What is a premium ? Answer : It's the price charged for an insurance policy. Q: How do the instructors define risk ? Answer : They define risk as the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of healthcare. Q: What are insurance companies ? Answer : The instructors define them as mainly private companies that have been set up to sell a product that we generally call health insurance. By selling that product and running their business, they end up pooling risk. Remarks : The product that these companies sell is something that we call an insurance policy . Q: What are some of the access challenges of healthcare? Answer : Lack of insurance coverage (e.g. in the US) Socioeconomic disparities Differing levels of education Cultural issues Language barriers Lack of providers Q: Describe the different levels of care. Answer : Primary care : often the first point of entry for medical care; provided by primary care physicians (commonly outpatient setting) Secondary care : often referred by primary care; provided by specialists, e.g. cardiologists (outpatient and inpatient settings) Tertiary care : referred from secondary or primary care; usually provided by highly specialized physicians (mostly inpatient, sometimes outpatients settings) Quaternary care : most specialized care for rare and complex conditions (usually inpatient setting) Q: What does it mean when we say some physicians work in inpatient settings ? Answer : We usually mean healthcare provided to patients in hospitals. Remarks : Patients needing inpatient care are admitted to the hospital, stay there for a period of time and receive care, and then go home when they're done. Module 2 \u00b6 Physician Practices And Physician Payments \u00b6 Q: Which incentives are generated by FFS payment systems and what are associated risks? Answer : FFS creates incentives to increase the number of services and favor more expensive ones. While this ensures that the patient gets what is needed, it creates the risk of overuse . Q: What is Medicare ? Answer : It is the US government payer that provides coverage for people mainly over the age of 65. Q: Which incentives are generated by capitation payment systems and what are associated risks? Answer : Capitation creates the incentive to reduce the number of services and generally provide less care. While this reduces the amount of unnecessary services, it increases the risk of underuse . Q: What is Fee for Service (FFS) payment? Answer : In this payment model, a doctor is paid for each service that she or he provides. Q: Explain how capitation payments can lead to a shift of risk from the intermediary to the provider. Answer : Capitation payment means that the provider is payed per patient and unit of time, irrespective of the number of services. This means that, especially for solo practice and small physician groups, there is the risk that the fixed, prospective payments insufficiently cover the actually provided care. Q: What are the three challenges for the quality of healthcare? Answer : Underuse Overuse Misuse Example : Underuse : Variety of cases where beneficial, preventive care is not used as widely as it could be or perhaps should be. Overuse : Performing MRI scans for too many patients with low back pain. Misuse : Giving a patient a medication that interacted badly with another medicine the patient was taking, leading to problems maybe because someone wasn't keeping track well enough of all the medications that a patient was taking. Q: How do the instructors define capitation payment? Answer : It is defined as a payment system in which a physician is payed a fixed amount per patient, per unit of time. Remarks : This can be seen as the opposite from FFS payment. Module 3 \u00b6 Hospitals And Payment Systems \u00b6 Q: What is an integrated delivery network ( IDN )? Answer : It is an entity that owns, or closely integrates, many providers of different types to provide a broad range of care. Q: What are admitting privileges ? Answer : These are arrangements for physicians to provide services at a hospital. Remarks : In this case, physician practice and hospital are still separate businesses and probably paid separately. Q: What is a hospital network ? Answer : It is a group of hospitals with whom an insurer works, and which enrollees are required or encouraged to use. Q: What is the global budget model ? Answer : It is a payment system for inpatient care, where the hospital is paid a fixed amount for a period of time (often a year). Q: What are physician-hospital organizations ( PHO 's)? Answer : These are larger organizations consisting of many hospitals that are part of the same company. Q: What is pay-for-performance ( P4P )? Answer : It is the use of financial incentives or penalties based on whether or not a provider meets some set of performance expectations (focused on the quality of care). Q: What is a personal health record ( PHR )? Answer : It commonly refers to an electronic application for patients to record their own personal health information. Remarks : This may be for the patients' own use or to share with their healthcare providers. Q: What are Diagnosis-Related Groups ( DRG )? Answer : It is a payment system where hospitals are paid a flat amount for each patient's hospital stay based on the given diagnosis. Q: How can FFS, Per diem, DRG and Global budget systems be arranged according to the amount of risk transferred from intermediaries to hospitals? Answer : They can be arranged from less risk to most risk transferred according to: Fee for service Per diem Diagnosis-related group Global budget Q: What are hospital systems ? Answer : These are larger organizations consisting of many hospitals that are part of the same company. Q: How do we call large PHO's with a broader representation of physicians? Answer : We then apply the term: integrated delivery network ( IDN ). Q: What is an Accountable Care Organization ( ACO )? Answer : It is an organization that works to create clinical integration ( providers work together to deliver integrated and coordinated patient care ) across many providers. Remarks : Here, each provider or organization can voluntarily associate with the ACO, have some contractual arrangements, but stay in their own separate organization. Q: What is a chargemaster of a hospital? Answer : It is a list of all the services that a hospital provides, and the amount that the hospital charges for each service. Q: How does per diem payment work? Answer : In a per diem payment system intermediaries pay a fixed amount to the hospital for each patient per day. Remarks : This payment is a prospective payment since it does not regard the actual hospital's charges incurred for the provided services. Q: What is a defining characteristic of a hospital? Answer : The provision of beds and infrastructure for inpatient care. Q: What are the two kinds of relationships between hospitals and physicians? Answer : Hospitals may employ physicians directly. A physician may have an arrangement to practice at the hospital, but still have a separate practice. Q: Which are the four payment systems for hospitals? Answer : Fee for service Per diem Diagnosis-related group Global budget Q: How can FFS, Per diem, DRG and Global budget systems be arranged according to incentives they create? Answer : They can be arranged according to the incentive they create to provide care from most care to least care in the following way: Fee for service Per diem Diagnosis-related group Global budget Remarks : More care can lead to overuse, less care can lead to underuse! Q: What is an electrical medical record ( EMR )? Answer : It is a digitized version of a patient's medical record. Q: What are hospitals ? Answer : They are organizations that provide facilities and staff to offer medical care. Remarks : They can operate as private businesses, on a for-profit or a not-for-profit basis, and some hospitals are owned or operated by governmet organizations. Module 4 \u00b6 Intermediaries And Health Care Financing \u00b6 Q: What are the five tools that intermediaries can use to influence health care use and spending? Answer : The management of provider availability and network : deciding which providers to work with. Provider Payment Methods and Levels: defining the structures governing payments to providers, in order to influence care use and costs. Patient cost sharing : used to influence care use and costs. Utilization Review, Gatekeepers, and Other Methods of Directly Influencing Care : a set of tools to directly control or manage utilization. Coverage Decisions : influence care use and costs by limiting the services the plan will cover. Q: What is a network provider panel ? Answer : It is the set of providers organized by an intermediary to care for enrolled patients. Q: What is selective contracting ? Answer : It is the selection of only a subset of providers into the intermediaries' network. Q: How do closed , open , and semi-open / semi-closed panels differ from each other? Answer : In a closed panel plan enrollees may only see providers in the panel, or else the intermediary won't contribute to the costs of care. In an open panel plan the intermediary allows its members to go to any provider that they want. In a semi-open or a semi-closed panel, enrollees are incentivized to go to providers in the network with maybe favorable cost-sharing, but the plan might still cover some of the cost if patients go outside the network. Q: What are the three common health plan designs? Answer : Traditional insurance or tradiational indemnity insurance : this usually involves minimal use of the five tools. Health maintenance organization ( HMO ): the name stems from the intent to focus on prevention and maintenance of health, as opposed to traditional focus on treating people once they get sick and less on keeping them healthy. Preferred provider organization ( PPO ): its use of tools lies inbetween HMO and traditional insurance. Example : Traditional : Open panel, FFS, No gatekeepers, limited use of utilization review, often higher patient cost sharing. HMO : Defined network and closed panel, stronger provider payment incentives, commonly gatekeepers and utilization review, often less patient cost sharing. PPO : semi-open/semi-closed panel, moderate provider payment incentives, gatekeeper uncommon, some patient cost sharing. Q: What is \"managed care\"? Answer : A health plan design is defined as \u201cmanaged care\u201d if the intermediary aims to manage the care of its enrollees through the use of the intermediary tools. Example : Examples are HMOs and PPOs. Module 5 \u00b6 Healthcare Products And Prescription Drugs \u00b6 Q: Which are the two main groups of drugs? Answer : Prescription drugs Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs Remarks : Prescription drugs require a prescription to obtain them, while over-the-counter drugs do not. Q: Sketch the steps a prescription drug has to go through in order to get approval by the FDA. Answer : The approval process is initiated by the drug company through filing an investigational new drug application ( IND ). If the FDA approves, the drug company is allowed to test the drug in humans in a series of sucessive trials called Phase I (basic tests about drug safety; below 100 healthy subjects), Phase II (testing efficacy and side effects; 100-300 subjects with target condition), and Phase III (testing long-term side effects and compare to alternative therapies; 1000-3000 subjects with target condition). If all three phases are successful, the drug company can file a new drug application ( NDA ), and if approved, can start marketing and selling the drug. Remarks : It takes a long time for drug approvals; 9 years is a general estimate number and it can cost many millions or even billions of dollars. Q: What is the difference between branded drugs and generic drugs? Answer : \u201c Branded \u201d drugs are sold with patent protection by the manufacturer that first brings the drug to the market. \u201c Generic \u201d drugs are sold by additional manufacturers after the primary manufacturer\u2019s patent expired. Remarks : Branded drugs tend to be more expensive. When generic drugs enter the market, competition drives down the price. Q: What's the formulary ? Answer : It is a list of drugs that a patient can buy and then get reimbursed for it. Q: What can a pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM ) do? Answer : Manage the design of prescription drug benefits (formularies or networks). Manage payments to pharmacies. Negotiate prices with pharmacies and negotiate rebates with manufacturers. Q: What is a pharmacy switch ? Answer : It is a third-party vendor used by pharmacists to transmit claims from the pharmacy to the PBMs. Remarks : They help the pharmacy determine all the rules about who pays what for what. They can take the insurance information, figure out which PBM is handling the coverage for the patient, electronically get the info about cost-sharing or other rules from the PBM, and then turn around and send it back.

Answer : Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the most common cancer-related cause of death in women in Germany. In 2018, about 72,000 incident cases were expected and about 19,000 women died from BC in 2016. Q: What do the authors conclude? Answer : The observed reduction of late-stage breast cancer incidence in the screening exposed age group in Germany is most likely to be attributed to the introduction of the national mammography screening program. In addition, the observed reduction of disease-specific mortality fits the expected pattern, but the proportion to which the mammography screening contributed to the reduction is unclear. These positive effects are bought at the cost of a moderate occurrence of overdiagnosis, especially by a sharp increase of in situ cancers. Q: Summarize the history of the German mammography screening program. Answer : To reduce the burden of BC in Germany a public debate about the implementation of an organized mammography screening started in the 1990s. Initial pilot projects were implemented in 2001. In 2002, the German parliament decided to introduce an organized, population-based national breast cancer screening program for women aged 50\u201369 years. In 2005, the rollout of the screening program, which is strictly following the European guidelines on breast cancer screening (EUREF), started and was completely implemented nation-wide until 2009. Key features of the program are: 94 mammography units (each covering a population of about 500,000 to 1 million), a centralized population-based invitation system, invitation every 2 years with a proposal of time and place for the examination, independent double reading of mammograms, high level quality assurance by reference centers and a national evaluation unit with yearly benchmarking. Today almost 100% of German women aged 50 to 69 years are invited to the mammography screening every 2 years, and participation rate is about 50% since the year 2009.","title":"Breast cancer incidence and mortality before and after implementation of the German mammography screening program"},{"location":"knowledge/breast_cancer_incidence_and_mortality_before_and_after_implementation_of_the_german_mammography_screening_program.html#breast-cancer-incidence-and-mortality-before-and-after-implementation-of-the-german-mammography-screening-program","text":"","title":"Breast cancer incidence and mortality before and after implementation of the German mammography screening program"},{"location":"knowledge/breast_cancer_incidence_and_mortality_before_and_after_implementation_of_the_german_mammography_screening_program.html#artificial-intelligence","text":"","title":"Artificial Intelligence"},{"location":"knowledge/breast_cancer_incidence_and_mortality_before_and_after_implementation_of_the_german_mammography_screening_program.html#health","text":"","title":"Health"},{"location":"knowledge/breast_cancer_incidence_and_mortality_before_and_after_implementation_of_the_german_mammography_screening_program.html#breast-cancer","text":"Q: Provide the numbers showing the seriousness of breast cancer in Germany. Answer : Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the most common cancer-related cause of death in women in Germany. In 2018, about 72,000 incident cases were expected and about 19,000 women died from BC in 2016. Q: What do the authors conclude? Answer : The observed reduction of late-stage breast cancer incidence in the screening exposed age group in Germany is most likely to be attributed to the introduction of the national mammography screening program. In addition, the observed reduction of disease-specific mortality fits the expected pattern, but the proportion to which the mammography screening contributed to the reduction is unclear. These positive effects are bought at the cost of a moderate occurrence of overdiagnosis, especially by a sharp increase of in situ cancers.

Answer : For each breast, they assign two binary labels: the absence/presence of malignant findings in a breast, and the absence/presence of benign findings in a breast. With left and right breasts, each exam has a total of four binary labels. The goal of the authors is to produce four predictions corresponding to the four labels for each exam. As input, they take four high-resolution images corresponding to the four standard screening mammography views. Example : Remarks : The authors crop each image to a fixed size of 2677 \u00d7 1942 pixels for CC views and 2974 \u00d7 1748 pixels for MLO views. Q: What are the contributions of the paper? Answer : 1) Primarily, the authors train and evaluate a set of strong neural networks on a mammography dataset, with biopsy-proven labels, that is of a massive size by the standards of medical image analysis, let alone breast cancer screening. They use two complimentary types of labels: breast-level labels indicating whether there is a benign or malignant finding in each breast, and pixel-level labels indicating the location of biopsied malignant and benign findings. To quantify the value of pixel-level labels, they compare a model using only breast-level labels against a model using both breast-level and pixel-level labels. The best model, trained on both breast-level and pixel-level labels, achieves an AUC of 0.895 in identifying malignant cases and 0.756 in identifying benign cases on a non-enriched test set reflecting the screening population. 2) In the reader study, the authors compared their best model to that of radiologists and found their model to be as accurate as radiologists both in terms of area under ROC curve (AUC) and area under precision-recall curve (PRAUC). They also found that a hybrid model, taking the average of the probabilities of malignancy predicted by a radiologist and by their neural network, yields more accurate predictions than either of the two separately. This suggests that the network and radiologists learned different aspects of the task and that their model could be effective as a tool providing radiologists a second reader. 3) Finally, the authors have made the code and weights of their best models available at https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier. With this contribution, research groups that are working on improving screening mammography, which may not have access to a large training dataset like theirs, will be able to directly use the model in their research or to use their pretrained weights as an initialization to train models with less data. By making the models public, the authors invite other groups to validate the results and test the robustness to shifts in the data distribution. Q: Provide the model architecture used for cancer classification. Answer : The authors trained a deep multi-view CNN of architecture shown in the figure below (inspired by \"High-resolution breast cancer screening with multi-view deep convolutional neural networks\", arXiv:1703.07047). The overall network consists of two core modules: (i) four view-specific columns, each based on the ResNet architecture that outputs a fixed-dimension hidden representation for each mammography view, and (ii) two fully connected layers to map from the computed hidden representations to the output predictions. The authors used four ResNet-22 columns to compute a 256-dimension hidden representation vector of each view. The columns applied to L-CC/R-CC views share their weights. The columns applied to L-MLO/R-MLO views share their weights, too. The authors concatenate the L-CC and R-CC representations into a 512-dimension vector, and apply two fully connected layers to generate predictions for the four outputs. They do the same for the L-MLO and R-MLO views. They average the probabilities predicted by the CC and MLO branches of the model to obtain their final predictions. Example : Remarks : ResNet-22 refers to our version of a 22-layer ResNet, with additional modifications such as a larger kernel in the first convolutional layer. Q: How did the authors evaluate their models? Answer : They evaluated their models primarily in terms of AUC (area under the ROC curve) for malignant/not malignant and benign/not benign classification tasks on the breast level. The model and readers\u2019 responses on the subset for reader study are evaluated in terms of AUC as well as precision-recall AUC (PRAUC), which are commonly used metrics in evaluation of radiologists\u2019 performance. Remarks : ROC and PRAUC capture diferent aspects of performance of a predictive model. The ROC curve summarizes the tradeof between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a model using diferent probability thresholds. The precision-recall curve summarizes the trade-of between the true positive rate (recall) and the positive predictive value (precision) for a model using diferent probability thresholds. Q: What is the patch-level model and why do the authors introduce it? Answer : The high resolution of the images and the limited memory of modern GPUs constrain the authors to use relatively shallow ResNets within their model when using full-resolution images as inputs. To further take advantage of the fine-grained detail in mammograms, they trained an auxiliary model to classify 256 \u00d7 256-pixel patches of mammograms, predicting two labels: the presence or absence of malignant and benign findings in a given patch. The labels for these patches are produced based on the pixel-level segmentations of the corresponding mammograms produced by clinicians. This approach allows to use a very deep auxiliary network at the patch level, as this network does not have to process the entire high-resolution image at once. Adding the heatmaps produced by the patch-level classifier as additional input channels allows the main classifier to get the benefit from pixel-level labels, while the heavy computation necessary to produce the pixel-level predictions does not need to be repeated each time an example is used for learning. Remarks : The authors refer to this model as a patch-level model , in contrast to the breast-level model which operates on images of the whole breast.","title":"Deep Neural Networks Improve Radiologists' Performance in Breast Cancer Screening"},{"location":"knowledge/deep_neural_networks_improve_radiologists%27_performance_in_breast_cancer_screening.html#deep-neural-networks-improve-radiologists-performance-in-breast-cancer-screening","text":"","title":"Deep Neural Networks Improve Radiologists' Performance in Breast Cancer Screening"},{"location":"knowledge/deep_neural_networks_improve_radiologists%27_performance_in_breast_cancer_screening.html#artificial-intelligence","text":"","title":"Artificial Intelligence"},{"location":"knowledge/deep_neural_networks_improve_radiologists%27_performance_in_breast_cancer_screening.html#health","text":"","title":"Health"},{"location":"knowledge/deep_neural_networks_improve_radiologists%27_performance_in_breast_cancer_screening.html#breast-cancer","text":"Q: Provide the authors' problem definition for cancer classification.

The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. (source: wikipedia/breast_cancer_screening ) Relevance : - What makes breast cancer screening a particularly crucial field of study is the combination of breast cancer being comparably 1. Very prevalent (most common cancer and cancer related cause of death in women) 2. Very curable if detected early enough - Further, in some countries, e.g. Germany, population-based screening programmes with invitation system exist, which leads to large demands and opportunities for AI-assisted diagnosis and decision support. A novel deep learning based framework for the detection and classification of breast cancer using transfer learning (July 1, 2019) \u00b6 ( SanaUllah Khan, Naveed Islam, Zahoor Jan, Ikram Ud Din, Joel J. P. C Rodrigues ) Link : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865519301059 Abstract : In this article, the authors proposed a novel deep learning framework for the detection and classification of breast cancer in breast cytology images using the concept of transfer learning. In general, deep learning architectures are modeled to be problem specific and is performed in isolation. Contrary to classical learning paradigms, which develop and yield in isolation, transfer learning is aimed to utilize the gained knowledge during the solution of one problem into another related problem. In the proposed framework, features from images are extracted using pre-trained CNN architectures, namely, GoogLeNet, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) and Residual Networks (ResNet), which are fed into a fully connected layer for classification of malignant and benign cells using average pooling classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, experiments are performed on standard benchmark data sets. It has been observed that the proposed framework outclass all the other deep learning architectures in terms of accuracy in detection and classification of breast tumor in cytology images. Highlights : - A deep learning-based framework is proposed for the classification of breast cancer in breast cytology images. - Three different deep learning architectures (GoogLeNet, VGGNet, and ResNet) have been analysed. - The proposed framework gives a high level of accuracy in the classification of breast cancer. The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review (2013-06) \u00b6 ( M. G. Marmot, D. G. Altman, D. A. Cameron, J. A. Dewar, S. G. Thompson, M. Wilcox ) Link : https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2013177 Abstract : The breast cancer screening programmes in the United Kingdom currently invite women aged 50\u201370 years for screening mammography every 3 years. Since the time the screening programmes were established, there has been debate, at times sharply polarised, over the magnitude of their benefit and harm, and the balance between them. The expected major benefit is reduction in mortality from breast cancer. The major harm is overdiagnosis and its consequences; overdiagnosis refers to the detection of cancers on screening, which would not have become clinically apparent in the woman\u2019s lifetime in the absence of screening. Professor Sir Mike Richards, National Cancer Director, England, and Dr Harpal Kumar, Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Research UK, asked Professor Sir Michael Marmot to convene and chair an independent panel to review the evidence on benefits and harms of breast screening in the context of the UK breast screening programmes. The panel, authors of this report, reviewed the extensive literature and heard testimony from experts in the field who were the main contributors to the debate. European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis (2013) \u00b6 ( I. Amendoeira, Et Al, N. Perry, M. Broeders, C. de Wolf, S. T\u00f6rnberg, R. Holland, L. von Karsa ) Link : http://bookshop.europa.eu/de/european-guidelines-for-quality-assurance-in-breast-cancer-screening-and-diagnosis-pbND0213386/ Abstract : The fourth edition of the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis was published by the European Commission in 2006. The present supplements to the fourth edition have been produced by the same groups of experts originally established under the Europe Against Cancer programme that have developed and updated the guidelines since the early 1990s. Over the years, the scope and the depth of the multidisciplinary guidelines have expanded, and recommendations and protocols have been updated to keep pace with developments in the field. The present supplements lay a cornerstone for a new, completely revised fifth edition of the guidelines Artificial intelligence for breast cancer detection in mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis: State of the art (June 9, 2020) \u00b6 ( Ioannis Sechopoulos, Jonas Teuwen, Ritse Mann ) Link : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X20301358 Abstract : The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the basic concepts and developments in the field AI for breast cancer detection in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. The pitfalls of conventional methods, and how these are, for the most part, avoided by this new technology, will be discussed. Importantly, studies that have evaluated the current capabilities of AI and proposals for how these capabilities should be leveraged in the clinical realm will be reviewed, while the questions that need to be answered before this vision becomes a reality are posed. Artificial Intelligence: A Primer for Breast Imaging Radiologists (August 10, 2020) \u00b6 ( Manisha Bahl ) Link : https://doi.org/10.1093/jbi/wbaa033 Abstract : Advances in AI technologies have led to techniques that could increase breast cancer detection, improve clinical efficiency in breast imaging practices, and guide decision-making regarding screening and prevention strategies. This article reviews key terminology and concepts, discusses common AI models and methods to validate and evaluate these models, describes emerging AI applications in breast imaging, and outlines challenges and future directions. Familiarity with AI terminology, concepts, methods, and applications is essential for breast imaging radiologists to critically evaluate these emerging technologies, recognize their strengths and limitations, and ultimately ensure optimal patient care. Breast cancer incidence and mortality before and after implementation of the German mammography screening program (2020-08-01) \u00b6 ( Alexander Katalinic, Nora Eisemann, Klaus Kraywinkel, Maria R. Noftz, Joachim H\u00fcbner ) Abstract : Effective population-based mammography screening should impact breast cancer (BC) incidence, age and stage-specific incidence and BC mortality. The authors aim to investigate such effects in a time period of 10\u2009years after implementation of the German mammography screening program. Data on 323,719 breast cancer patients from 2003 to 2014 for defined regions covering a population of 30 million inhabitants and official mortality data from 1998 to 2016 for almost the whole of Germany were used. The authors compared incidence and mortality rates for the prescreening time period (2003/2004) and the latest available data (2013/2014 and 2015/2016, respectively) and performed trend analyses using joinpoint regression models. In the screening exposed age groups (50-59 and 60-69\u2009years), BC incidence showed a typical prevalence peak with the introduction of the mammography screening, mainly driven by an increase of early-stage BC. For Stage III and IV BC incidence in 2013/2014 was 24.2 and 23.0% (age group 50-59\u2009years) and 28.3 and 24.2% (age group 60-69\u2009years) lower than in the prescreening period. From 2003/2004 to 2015/2016\u2009BC mortality decreased by 25.8 and 21.2%, respectively. As corresponding trends in nonexposed age groups were distinctly unfavorable, the reduction of late-stage BC incidence and BC mortality in the screening exposed age groups in Germany is most likely to be attributed to the introduction of the national mammography screening program. These positive effects are bought at the cost of a moderate occurrence of overdiagnosis, especially by a sharp increase of in situ cancers. Deep learning in breast radiology: current progress and future directions (2021-01-15) \u00b6 ( William C. Ou, Dogan Polat, Basak E. Dogan ) Abstract : This review provides an overview of current applications of deep learning methods within breast radiology. The diagnostic capabilities of deep learning in breast radiology continue to improve, giving rise to the prospect that these methods may be integrated not only into detection and classification of breast lesions, but also into areas such as risk estimation and prediction of tumor responses to therapy. Remaining challenges include limited availability of high-quality data with expert annotations and ground truth determinations, the need for further validation of initial results, and unresolved medicolegal considerations. Key Points : - Deep learning (DL) continues to push the boundaries of what can be accomplished by artificial intelligence (AI) in breast imaging with distinct advantages over conventional computer-aided detection. - DL-based AI has the potential to augment the capabilities of breast radiologists by improving diagnostic accuracy, increasing efficiency, and supporting clinical decision-making through prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response. - Remaining challenges to DL implementation include a paucity of prospective data on DL utilization and yet unresolved medicolegal questions regarding increasing AI utilization.

Their network achieves an AUC of 0.895 in predicting whether there is a cancer in the breast, when tested on the screening population. The authors attribute the high accuracy of their model to a two-stage training procedure, which allows them to use a very high-capacity patch-level network to learn from pixel-level labels alongside a network learning from macroscopic breast-level labels. To validate their model, they conducted a reader study with 14 readers, each reading 720 screening mammogram exams, and found their model to be as accurate as experienced radiologists when presented with the same data. Finally, the authors show that a hybrid model, averaging probability of malignancy predicted by a radiologist with a prediction of their neural network, is more accurate than either of the two separately. To better understand their results, the authors conduct a thorough analysis of the network's performance on different subpopulations of the screening population, model design, training procedure, errors, and properties of its internal representations.

Melnick, H. Mostofi, Lily Peng, J. Reicher, B. Romera-Paredes, R. Sidebottom, Mustafa Suleyman, Daniel Tse, K. C. Young, J. Fauw, S. Shetty ) Abstract : Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer before symptoms appear, enabling earlier therapy for more treatable disease Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives Here, the authors present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, the authors curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. The authors show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. They provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. The authors ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening. An artificial intelligence (AI) system performs as well as or better than radiologists at detecting breast cancer from mammograms, and using a combination of AI and human inputs could help to improve screening efficiency. nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier \u00b6 Link : https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier Abstract : This is an implementation of the model used for breast cancer classification as described in the paper \"Deep Neural Networks Improve Radiologists' Performance in Breast Cancer Screening\".

In general, deep learning architectures are modeled to be problem specific and is performed in isolation. Contrary to classical learning paradigms, which develop and yield in isolation, transfer learning is aimed to utilize the gained knowledge during the solution of one problem into another related problem. In the proposed framework, features from images are extracted using pre-trained CNN architectures, namely, GoogLeNet, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) and Residual Networks (ResNet), which are fed into a fully connected layer for classification of malignant and benign cells using average pooling classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, experiments are performed on standard benchmark data sets. It has been observed that the proposed framework outclass all the other deep learning architectures in terms of accuracy in detection and classification of breast tumor in cytology images. Highlights : - A deep learning-based framework is proposed for the classification of breast cancer in breast cytology images. - Three different deep learning architectures (GoogLeNet, VGGNet, and ResNet) have been analysed. - The proposed framework gives a high level of accuracy in the classification of breast cancer.","title":"A novel deep learning based framework for the detection and classification of breast cancer using transfer learning (July 1, 2019)"},{"location":"literature/breast_cancer_detection.html#the-benefits-and-harms-of-breast-cancer-screening-an-independent-review-2013-06","text":"( M.

Since the time the screening programmes were established, there has been debate, at times sharply polarised, over the magnitude of their benefit and harm, and the balance between them. The expected major benefit is reduction in mortality from breast cancer. The major harm is overdiagnosis and its consequences; overdiagnosis refers to the detection of cancers on screening, which would not have become clinically apparent in the woman\u2019s lifetime in the absence of screening. Professor Sir Mike Richards, National Cancer Director, England, and Dr Harpal Kumar, Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Research UK, asked Professor Sir Michael Marmot to convene and chair an independent panel to review the evidence on benefits and harms of breast screening in the context of the UK breast screening programmes. The panel, authors of this report, reviewed the extensive literature and heard testimony from experts in the field who were the main contributors to the debate.","title":"The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review (2013-06)"},{"location":"literature/breast_cancer_detection.html#european-guidelines-for-quality-assurance-in-breast-cancer-screening-and-diagnosis-2013","text":"( I.

The authors aim to investigate such effects in a time period of 10\u2009years after implementation of the German mammography screening program. Data on 323,719 breast cancer patients from 2003 to 2014 for defined regions covering a population of 30 million inhabitants and official mortality data from 1998 to 2016 for almost the whole of Germany were used. The authors compared incidence and mortality rates for the prescreening time period (2003/2004) and the latest available data (2013/2014 and 2015/2016, respectively) and performed trend analyses using joinpoint regression models. In the screening exposed age groups (50-59 and 60-69\u2009years), BC incidence showed a typical prevalence peak with the introduction of the mammography screening, mainly driven by an increase of early-stage BC. For Stage III and IV BC incidence in 2013/2014 was 24.2 and 23.0% (age group 50-59\u2009years) and 28.3 and 24.2% (age group 60-69\u2009years) lower than in the prescreening period.

AI for Medicine (offered by deeplearning.ai via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine Abstract : AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It\u2019s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients\u2019 future health, and recommend better treatments. This three-course Specialization will give you practical experience in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. Evaluations of AI Applications in Healthcare (offered by Stanford via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-healthcare Abstract : With artificial intelligence applications proliferating throughout the healthcare system, stakeholders are faced with both opportunities and challenges of these evolving technologies. This course explores the principles of AI deployment in healthcare and the framework used to evaluate downstream effects of AI healthcare solutions. AI in Healthcare Capstone (offered by Stanford via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-healthcare Abstract : This capstone project takes you on a guided tour exploring all the concepts we have covered in the different classes up till now. We have organized this experience around the journey of a patient who develops some respiratory symptoms and given the concerns around COVID19 seeks care with a primary care provider. We will follow the patient's journey from the lens of the data that are created at each encounter, which will bring us to a unique de-identified dataset created specially for this specialization. The data set spans EHR as well as image data and using this dataset, we will build models that enable risk-stratification decisions for our patient. We will review how the different choices you make -- such as those around feature construction, the data types to use, how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline -- affect the care that would be recommended by the model. During this exploration, we will also discuss the regulatory as well as ethical issues that come up as we attempt to use AI to help us make better care decisions for our patient. This course will be a hands-on experience in the day of a medical data miner. Introduction to Clinical Data (offered by Stanford via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-healthcare Abstract : This course introduces you to a framework for successful and ethical medical data mining. We will explore the variety of clinical data collected during the delivery of healthcare. You will learn to construct analysis-ready datasets and apply computational procedures to answer clinical questions. We will also explore issues of fairness and bias that may arise when we leverage healthcare data to make decisions about patient care. Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Healthcare (offered by Stanford via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-healthcare Abstract : Machine learning and artificial intelligence hold the potential to transform healthcare and open up a world of incredible promise. But we will never realize the potential of these technologies unless all stakeholders have basic competencies in both healthcare and machine learning concepts and principles. This course will introduce the fundamental concepts and principles of machine learning as it applies to medicine and healthcare. We will explore machine learning approaches, medical use cases, metrics unique to healthcare, as well as best practices for designing, building, and evaluating machine learning applications in healthcare. The course will empower those with non-engineering backgrounds in healthcare, health policy, pharmaceutical development, as well as data science with the knowledge to critically evaluate and use these technologies. AI in Healthcare Specialization (offered by Stanford via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-healthcare Abstract : Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries around the world, and has the potential to radically alter the field of healthcare. Imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic, medications prescribed, lab tests, and procedures performed, as well as data outside the health system -- such as social media, purchases made using credit cards, census records, Internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information, and you\u2019ll get a sense of how AI could transform patient care and diagnoses. In this specialization, we'll discuss the current and future applications of AI in healthcare with the goal of learning to bring AI technologies into the clinic safely and ethically. This specialization is designed for both healthcare providers and computer science professionals, offering insights to facilitate collaboration between the disciplines. Introduction to Healthcare (offered by Stanford via Coursera) \u00b6 Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-healthcare?specialization=ai-healthcare Abstract : Solving the problems and challenges within the U.S. healthcare system requires a deep understanding of how the system works. Successful solutions and strategies must take into account the realities of the current system. This course explores the fundamentals of the U.S. healthcare system. It will introduce the principal institutions and participants in healthcare systems, explain what they do, and discuss the interactions between them. The course will cover physician practices, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, and insurance and financing arrangements. We will also discuss the challenges of healthcare cost management, quality of care, and access to care. While the course focuses on the U.S. healthcare system, we will also refer to healthcare systems in other developed countries. Machine Learning for Healthcare (MIT 6.S897/HST.S53) \u00b6 Link : https://mlhc17mit.github.io/ Abstract : Explores machine learning methods for clinical and healthcare applications. Covers concepts of algorithmic fairness, interpretability, and causality.

Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless. Relevance : - We lose what we don't use. Thanks to you, evolution... - I use Anki whenever I want to remember facts and knowledge. In fact, what you find at https://pwenker.com/ai_and_health/knowledge also lives in an Anki collection and was exported from there. - Two things you should look up, if you don't know them: 1.

Zotero | Your personal research assistant \u00b6 Link : https://www.zotero.org/ Abstract : Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. Relevance : - Zotero is a corner stone of my research! - I use it to organize my research - To give you a very specific example, let's look at what you are reading right now! I opened the Zotero webpage in my browser and used a Zotero browser extension, to import this snapshot with only one click. Zotero already fills in some information automatically, like the link to the webpage, the title, and often times a fitting abstract. I only added the very sentences you are reading now into the Abstract field of the entry. Then I used some Python scripting to export the whole collection (including this very entry) to the repository you are currently looking at. Connected Papers | Find and explore academic papers \u00b6 Link : https://www.connectedpapers.com/ Abstract : A unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work. Relevance : - If you start researching a new field, it's often a struggle to find good introductory research papers. Here, Connected Papers comes to your rescue! - I like to start a literature research by just putting the name of the field, e.g. Deep Reinforcement Learning into the Connected Papers search field and let it build a graph. - It immediately shows you (at least some of) the most relevant and foundational research papers (node size) and useful connections between them (edges). ShortScience.org - Making Science Accessible! \u00b6 Link : https://www.shortscience.org/ Abstract : ShortScience.org is a platform for post-publication discussion aiming to improve accessibility and reproducibility of research ideas. The website has 1547 public summaries, mostly in machine learning, written by the community and organized by paper, conference, and year. Reading summaries of papers is useful to obtain the perspective and insight of another reader, why they liked or disliked it, and their attempt to demystify complicated sections. Also, writing summaries is a good exercise to understand the content of a paper because you are forced to challenge your assumptions when explaining it. Finally, you can keep up to date with the flood of research by reading the latest summaries on our Twitter and Facebook pages. Relevance : - This is best explained by: https://www.shortscience.org/about Papers with Code - The latest in Machine Learning \u00b6 Link : https://paperswithcode.com/ Abstract : Papers With Code highlights trending Machine Learning research and the code to implement it. Relevance : - What's is the worth of a research paper without an actual implementation? Often times: nothing . - Papers With Code has the laudable mission to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code and evaluation tables. - It's an amazing starting place to find datasets, benchmarks and research papers with high-quality implementations. - I also find it particularly useful to get an overview about which subcategories a specific field has. For example, https://paperswithcode.com/area/medical helped me to choose an initial structure for this research collection. Google Scholar \u00b6 Link : https://scholar.google.com/ Abstract : Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Relevance : - I simply use Google Scholar to find research papers. - Additionally, it allows you, for a given research paper, to find other papers that cite it, or that are deemed to be similar.

Here, Connected Papers comes to your rescue! - I like to start a literature research by just putting the name of the field, e.g. Deep Reinforcement Learning into the Connected Papers search field and let it build a graph. - It immediately shows you (at least some of) the most relevant and foundational research papers (node size) and useful connections between them (edges).","title":"Connected Papers | Find and explore academic papers"},{"location":"literature/general_research_resources.html#shortscienceorg-making-science-accessible","text":"Link : https://www.shortscience.org/ Abstract : ShortScience.org is a platform for post-publication discussion aiming to improve accessibility and reproducibility of research ideas. The website has 1547 public summaries, mostly in machine learning, written by the community and organized by paper, conference, and year. Reading summaries of papers is useful to obtain the perspective and insight of another reader, why they liked or disliked it, and their attempt to demystify complicated sections. Also, writing summaries is a good exercise to understand the content of a paper because you are forced to challenge your assumptions when explaining it. Finally, you can keep up to date with the flood of research by reading the latest summaries on our Twitter and Facebook pages.

Netflix knows what movies people like to watch and Google knows what people want to know based on their search histories. Indeed, Google has recently begun to replace much of its existing non\u2013machine learning technology with machine learning algorithms, and there is great optimism that these techniques can provide similar improvements across many sectors. It is no surprise then that medicine is awash with claims of revolution from the application of machine learning to big health care data. Recent examples have demonstrated that big data and machine learning can create algorithms that perform on par with human physicians. Though machine learning and big data may seem mysterious at first, they are in fact deeply related to traditional statistical models that are recognizable to most clinicians.

Chen, Rajesh Ranganath ) Link : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233077/ Abstract : Modern electronic health records (EHRs) provide data to answer clinically meaningful questions. The growing data in EHRs makes healthcare ripe for the use of machine learning. However, learning in a clinical setting presents unique challenges that complicate the use of common machine learning methodologies. For example, diseases in EHRs are poorly labeled, conditions can encompass multiple underlying endotypes, and healthy individuals are underrepresented. This article serves as a primer to illuminate these challenges and highlights opportunities for members of the machine learning community to contribute to healthcare.
